## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

### 📊 Data Collection Limitations
- Some time data was missing due to manual recording during busy selling periods.
- Inconsistent price entries were observed across some transactions.

### 🛍️ Operational Challenges
- Lack of clear product display (no tarpaulin or price board) made it difficult for customers to quickly view available items and prices.
- Environmental factors such as rain and heat reduced overall customer traffic.

### 💰 Pricing & Competition Issues
- Some products were perceived as overpriced compared to nearby competitors.
- Strong competition from other stalls, particularly for beverages like buko juice, affected sales.

### 🎨 Product Appeal Factors
- Certain items, such as cupcakes, had lower visual appeal, which may have contributed to weaker demand.
